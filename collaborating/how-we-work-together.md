# ü§ù How we Work Together

Being a global community means that all community members are either contributing from home or from wherever they may be around the globe!

### Etiquette Practices

We intend to onboard folks from many different cultures, from all across the world, making aspects of work uniquely challenging. These challenges include the obvious like collaborating across time zones, and arranging how to bring new dog rescues into the platform; but also the less obvious like respecting each other, community members, and all those involved in working to support web3 and dog rescues.\
